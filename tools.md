### SUMO: SUpervised MOdularisation

[SUMO](https://bitbucket.org/mathew_hall/sumo) is a tool designed to complement existing automated approaches to software modularisation by making the incorporation of domain knowledge as easy as possible.

It uses a constraint solver to compute a modified package structure according to relations specified by the user, starting from either the original package structure or one created by another automated remodularisation tool 

It's BSD licensed; the source code and binary are available on [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/mathew_hall/sumo).

As part of his work for his Masters degree, Mohammad Ali Khojaye built an Eclipse plugin to the tool, which is available [here](https://bitbucket.org/makhojaye/java-eclipse-automated-remodularisation-refactoring-tool).



### Crunch: Evolutionary Clustering of Graphs

Crunch is a search-based clustering tool that replicates a subset of Brian Mitchell's [BUNCH clustering tool](https://github.com/ArchitectingSoftware/Bunch).

Crunch is [open source and available on Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/mathew_hall/crunch). Documentation is available on the [project wiki](https://bitbucket.org/mathew_hall/crunch/wiki/Home). It is designed to allow hierarchical clustering of graphs using several fitness functions. It includes an adapter that allows existing Bunch fitness functions to be used.
