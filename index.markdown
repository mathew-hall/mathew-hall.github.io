I am broadly interested in automating software engineering. I work in the area of search-based software engineering (SBSE). I am particularly interested in automatic test data generation, fuzzing, and applications of theorem proving or other tools to augment search-based techniques.

Alongside my research I am interested in improving the workflow and tooling used in software engineering research:

 * Research workflow automation
 * Reproducible research
 * Research software engineering
 * Statistics
